# stc-screen-recorder — Claude Code handoff

macOS screen recorder. Electron UI + Swift helper. Captures display + cursor
events → deterministic transform → CFR MP4 with cursor overlay.

## Where things are

| path | what |
|---|---|
| `PHASE-1.md` | current phase plan — read this first |
| `docs/PHASE-0-FINDINGS.md` | spike results; all settled decisions sourced here |
| `helper/src/` | Swift helper (increment 1, in progress) |
| `helper/src/Protocol.swift` | JSON-line IPC + Clock |
| `helper/src/Watchers.swift` | display/device watchers |
| `helper/src/main.swift` | App lifecycle, command dispatch |
| `helper/build.sh` | builds and signs; `SIGN_ID="..." ./build.sh` to override |
| `app/src/` | Electron app (not yet started) |

## Current status

- **Increment 0 (transform contract):** NOT STARTED — must happen before increment 1 ships
- **Increment 1 (helper control plane):** IN PROGRESS — protocol, watchers, and lifecycle are
  substantially done; no capture yet

**Critical ordering rule:** the transform defines the schemas; the helper is a producer to spec.
Do not ship increment 1 until increment 0's `events.json` / `anchors.json` / `project` schemas
exist and the helper emits to them.

## The non-negotiable

`render(project, events, t) → FrameState` is a pure function — no wall clock, no decoder
scheduling, no live helper stats, no current display state. Preview and export are two sinks
that call it with different `t` sequences. One implementation; sinks may not fork the transform.

## Settled decisions (do not relitigate)

See `PHASE-1.md` → "Settled by phase 0" for the full table. The ones most likely to matter:

- **Frame selection:** at time `t`, use the source frame with the greatest PTS ≤ `t`; hold,
  never interpolate. Same rule in both sinks — never "latest decoded frame."
- **Simulation step:** 120 Hz (`dt = 1/120 s`); 60 fps export samples every other tick. All
  times are integer nanoseconds or integer sim ticks — no float seconds inside the transform.
- **Cursor state:** function of sim tick `n = floor(t_ns × 120 / 1_000_000_000)`, not render
  call count. `stateAt(n)` must be identical whether reached by stepping or seeking.
- **Clock:** `mach_timebase_info()` at helper startup; numer/denom written into `anchors.json`.
  `displayTimeNs = displayTime × numer / denom` (41.667 ns/tick here, but read it, don't assume).
  `CGEvent.timestamp` is already nanoseconds — do not convert.
- **Capture:** VFR at capture, CFR at export. Hardware encode only (`prefer-hardware`).
- **IPC:** stdout = lossy/non-blocking stats (drop-oldest, never block capture callbacks);
  stdin + fd3 = reliable request/response with sequence numbers. Never let stats back-pressure
  the capture graph.
- **Signing:** ad-hoc revokes TCC on every rebuild. A self-signed cert in the login keychain
  is needed before increment 2. Run both experiments in PHASE-1.md → Signing before capture
  work starts.

## Increment 0 — what to build next

1. Write `events.json`, `anchors.json`, and `project` schemas (versioned; `project` holds
   PiP geometry, cursor style, output fps — the edit document, even if it's 3 fields for now).
2. Hand-author a 5-second fixture session (no capture) containing cursor motion that exercises
   easing across VFR grid boundaries.
3. Implement `render(project, events, t)` against the fixture — no WebCodecs or DOM dependencies.
4. Wire two sinks: canvas preview + WebCodecs encode (demux via mp4box.js).
5. Gate: for 200 sampled `t`, the pre-encode RGBA buffer from each sink is byte-identical.
   Two independent exports produce matching pre-encode hashes. Encoded MP4s need not be
   byte-identical (container timestamps and encoder state are not contractually deterministic).

## Phase 1 scope (sprint)

Display capture + cursor events only. No camera, mic, system audio, display hot-swap rebuild,
segmentation, or fault-injection soak. See `PHASE-1.md` → Non-goals for the explicit deferred list.

`AVAssetWriter` cannot change output dimensions mid-file — a display resolution change must stop
the recording cleanly, not rebuild mid-stream (phase 2 concern).

## Correctness traps to watch for

- **Byte-identical MP4 is not the gate** — muxer timestamps and encoder state differ between
  runs. Hash pre-encode RGBA buffers, not container output.
- **Stats on stdout can block capture** — all stats writes must go through a bounded ring buffer
  on a dedicated writer thread with non-blocking fd; no capture callback may touch the pipe.
- **`stateAt(n)` seek cost** — at 120 Hz, 30 min = 216k ticks. If seek is implemented as
  "step from tick 0," a 60 fps export of a long recording is quadratic. Plan checkpoints.
- **`AVAssetWriter` dimension rigidity** — see above; display hot-swap is a stop, not a rebuild.
- **WebCodecs demux** — WebCodecs accepts `EncodedVideoChunk`, not MP4. mp4box.js (already in
  `scratch/`) is the demuxer. `VideoDecoder` is async; the sink needs a pre-decoded frame cache,
  not synchronous decoder calls inside `render()`.
- **mach timebase** — 41.667 ns/tick on this machine; Intel is 1/1. Always `mach_timebase_info()`.
